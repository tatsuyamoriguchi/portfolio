  - A friend from Silicon Valley referred me to the owners of OSP, Inc (Tokyo, Japan)
  - OSP decided to assign me as CEO of their US subsidiary, Open System's Production 2, Inc.
  - OSP2 was incorporated in Irvine, CA to provide mega size Japanese companies of SAP infrastructure systems maintenance and operation services.
  - As CEO, I was responsible for the whole operation from hiring, HR, payroll, accounting, taxation, contracting, legal, ISMS(ISO27001), facility management, client interface, etc.
  - Hired Japanese bilingual technical support engineers, managed 5 - 6 engineers
  - The owner of OSP had developed health problem along with financial issue due to the termination of Fujitsu contract, no longer able to obtain enough operation budget.
  - I suggested the owner to close Open System's Production 2, Inc before running out of payroll fund. Then I was advised to leave, and the board of directors voted my termination.
  - To save OSP2 employees jobs in forthcoming months, I contacted few similar Japanese companies to set up AWS cloud devop support center, but failed. 
  - OSP was dissolved few months later, and only two staffs were transfered to another group company. If I started AWS support services earlier, I could have saved those local staffs' jobs.
- Wanted to take a break for 1 or 2 years. Totaly lost motivation of management career. Accidentally bought a book, "iPhone Development with Swift 3" at Burns & Nobles, and bought a rehurbished mid-2012 MacBook Pro, then started programming.
