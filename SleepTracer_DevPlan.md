# Sleep Tracer version 1 iOS App Development Plan
Sleep Tracer is a tentative app name.

## Product Concept
1. To provide a handy and easy to use tool to detect the possibility of a user’s sleep disorder symptom.
2. To educate users about sleep apnea and other sleeping issues
3. To give users health care options nearby for possible sleeping disorder and other symptoms
4. To promote clinics and institutions with Sleep Tracer

    * How to monitor your breathing rate with Apple Watch  
    * https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-apnea/sleep-respiratory-rate   
    * Using its built-in accelerometer, the Apple Watch can track the number of breaths you take per minute while asleep.

    * 1 to 2 Years: 24 to 40 breaths per minute
    * 3 to 5 Years: 22 to 34 breaths per minute
    * 6 to 12 Years: 18 to 30 breaths per minute
    * 13 to 17 Years: 12 to 20 breaths per minute
    * 18 to 65 Years: 12 to 20 breaths per minute
    * 66 to 80 Years: 12 to 28 breaths per minute
    * 81 or older: 10 to 30 breaths per minute
* Low respiratory rate during sleep
    * Sleep Apnea
    * Asthma or other lung disorders
    * Heartburn
    * Pneumonia
    * Allergic reaction
    * Heart conditions and cardiac arrest
    * Drug use or overdose, particularly of a central nervous system depressant
