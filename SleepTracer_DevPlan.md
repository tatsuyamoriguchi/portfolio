2. To educate users about sleep apnea and other sleeping issues
3. To give users health care options nearby for possible sleeping disorder and other symptoms
4. To promote clinics and institutions with Sleep Tracer

## Basic features and technologies to implement and learn
- [ ] Software architecture and maintaining code quality -> MVVM
- [ ] Front end development UI/UX design -> SwiftUI
- [ ] Unit Test with TDD
- [ ] UI test
- [ ] Integrate Circle CI.
- [ ] GitHub
- [x] Accessing HealthKit data (Respiratory reate)
- [ ] Loading respiratory data from Apple Watch for testing purpose.
- [x] Analyze respiratory data with a threshold 
- [x] Research how respiratory data is recorded. What causes the time length variation between two measured points.
