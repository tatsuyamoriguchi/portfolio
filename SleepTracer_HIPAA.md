In the States, this personally identifiable health information, once shared with an entity like a hospital or doctor is subject to the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act [(HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) protections and compliance requirements. 

Covered Entities are the health care providers and payers that people use to get and pay for health services. From doctors, to clinics, hospitals and insurers, these organizations provide and pay for healthcare. 

Protected Health Information (PHI) is the personally identifiable health information that patients share with covered entities in the course of care. PHI can be everything from test results, to MRI scans, to something as simple as appointment schedules and phone logs. 

Business Associates are the companies and third parties that manage protected health data on behalf of covered entities in the process of providing service to patients. Business associates include the application developers building new apps for Apple’s HealthKit, hosting providers that handle PHI, and other offline service providers. If you’re building an application that handles, or could handle PHI, you are considered by law - whether you want to be or not - a Business Associate.
