# Mobile App Development Lifecycle

References [Mobile Application Development Lifecycle: 5 Key Phases](https://blog.kms-solutions.asia/mobile-app-development-lifecycle)

1. Inception - Every software begins with a concept. Typically, such a concept is evolved into a strong foundation for an application.
2. Design - The design phase include establishing the app's User Experience (UX), such as the overall layout, how it operates, and so on, as well as translating that UX into a good User Interface (UI) design, which is generally done with the assistance of a graphic designer.
3. Development — The actual creation of the application is usually the most resource-intensive step.
4. Stabilization — Once development has progressed far enough, QA generally begins testing the program and fixing issues. Frequently, an application will enter a restricted beta phase in which a larger user population is given the opportunity to try it out and provide feedback and suggestions for improvements.
5. Deployment.

Many of these parts often overlap

## Inception
Before submitting an app to one of the public App Stores, keep the following points in mind:

Are there any similar apps presently on the market? If that's the case, how does this software differ from others?
In the case of apps that will be distributed within an organization:

Infrastructure Integration — How will it work with or enhance existing infrastructure?
Apps should also be assessed in the context of the mobile form factor:

What value does this app provide to its users? What will they do with it?
Form/Mobility — How will this app function on a mobile device? How can I use mobile technologies like location awareness, the camera, and others to offer value?
Defining Actors and Use Cases might be helpful when creating the functionality of an app. Actors are users who play a part in an application. Actions or intentions are commonly used as use cases.

It's considerably easier to start building an application once you've gathered a sufficient number of use cases and actors. The development team may then concentrate on how to build the app rather than what it is or should do.

## Design
Designing a user experience

Wireframes or mockups, created with one of the various design toolkits, are typically used to create UX. UX mockups help you to develop the user experience without having to worry about the UI design
* Human Interface Guidelines for Apple
* Design Guidelines for Android
* UWP - UWP Design Fundamentals

The next stage is to construct the UI design after the UX has been chosen. 
While most UX mockups are black and white, the UI Design phase is where colors, graphics, and other elements are added and finished

## Development
In reality, once an idea has matured in the conceptual/inspiration phase, a functioning prototype is typically created to check functionality, assumptions, and to assist define the scope of the project.

## Stabilization
* functionality
* usability
* performance

* Prototype — The app is still in the proof-of-concept stage, with just fundamental functionality or select elements of the app functional. There are a lot of bugs.
* Alpha — The majority of the core functionality is code-complete (built, but not fully tested). Major issues still exist, and outlying functionality may not be available.
* Beta — The majority of the functionality is now complete, and it has undergone some light testing and problem fixes. Major flaws that have been identified may still exist.
* Release Candidate: All functionality has been tested and is complete. The software is ready to be released into the world, barring any additional issues.

## Distribution

* Apple App Store - The App Store, which is integrated into Mac OS X via iTunes, is a worldwide accessible online program repository. It's by far the most common form of app distribution, allowing developers to sell and distribute their programs online with minimal effort.
* In-House Deployment — This method is used for the internal distribution of company programs that aren't published on the App Store.
* Ad-Hoc Deployment — Ad-hoc deployment is used for development and testing, and it allows you to deploy to a small number of fully supplied devices. Ad-hoc deployment is what happens when you use Xcode or Visual Studio for Mac to deploy to a device.



# How long does it take to make an app?
Reference: [Mobile App Development Life Cycle Explained!](https://www.claysys.com/blog/mobile-app-development-life-cycle/)

## Planning stage (First 2-3 weeks)  
## Business Analysis Stage (2-3 weeks) 
build and set up the outline of the project. The business analysis stage also considers the purpose, usage, and implementation of the app. This involves studying the competitors, the size of the market, demographics, and success parameters. 
## Design and Pre-development stage (5-7 weeks) 
the initial stage in app development as you develop the basic concept, the design, and other relevant elements including the graphics, UI layout (user Interface), and color schemes
## UI-Design stage (3-4 weeks) 
User Interface designing involves deciding the colors, fonts, and images for your app that attracts the target audience once the app is launched.
## Development stage (8-10 weeks) 
UI design, front-end development, and back-end development
## Testing Stage (2 weeks) 
## Finalization and launch (1 week) 
receive feedback from beta testers on making improvements to the app. 
## Post-launch support and maintenance stage (2 weeks) 
identify and fix any bugs or glitches or to update features in your app that do not perform properly. The post-launch support and maintenance phase is crucial as it also gives the idea to bring a marketing strategy to increase the success rate of the app.
