1. Inception - Every software begins with a concept. Typically, such a concept is evolved into a strong foundation for an application.
2. Design - The design phase include establishing the app's User Experience (UX), such as the overall layout, how it operates, and so on, as well as translating that UX into a good User Interface (UI) design, which is generally done with the assistance of a graphic designer.
3. Development — The actual creation of the application is usually the most resource-intensive step.
4. Stabilization — Once development has progressed far enough, QA generally begins testing the program and fixing issues. Frequently, an application will enter a restricted beta phase in which a larger user population is given the opportunity to try it out and provide feedback and suggestions for improvements.
5. Deployment.
